  AI-Powered Code Reviewer and Quality Assistant

Project Description:

  The AI-Powered Code Reviewer and Quality Assistant is an intelligent tool designed to automatically analyze Python codebases and improve overall code quality.
It combines static code analysis, large language models (LLMs), and developer-friendly interfaces to assist in reviewing, validating, and enhancing code.
  The system detects missing or incomplete docstrings, evaluates code quality metrics, validates documentation standards, and generates high-quality docstrings using AI.
An optional Streamlit web dashboard allows developers to visually review results, accept or reject AI suggestions, and run tests interactively.
This tool helps teams maintain consistent documentation and quality standards while significantly reducing manual review effort.
